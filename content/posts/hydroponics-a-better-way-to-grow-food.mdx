When you think about the produce grown for concession food service
operations, do you picture acres of open fields, rows of tilled soil, and
seedlings lining the tops of the mounds? While much of the world’s fruits and
vegetables are grown this way, there are other ways to grow produce without
large amounts of land — and even without soil!

### What Are the Benefits of Hydroponics?

Hydroponic plants produce a greater yield of fruits and vegetables because in
a hydroponic system plants are more densely spaced together compared to the
size of land that would be needed to grow the same number of plants. Also, in
a hydroponic system many of the elements that can enhance plant growth — such
as the pH level of the water, nutrient content of the water, amount and type
of light, etc.

### What Are the types of Hydroponic Systems?

Plants are positioned on a floating surface hanging in a trough that is
slightly tilted. The plant roots hang with the upper part of the root system
exposed to air (oxygen). The bottom part of the roots is exposed to
nutrient-filled water that is pumped into the trough at the upper (higher)
end. The water flows past (down) the other root systems and back into a water
reservoir.
