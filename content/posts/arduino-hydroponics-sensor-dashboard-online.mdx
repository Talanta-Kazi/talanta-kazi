For this build, we are going to use an Arduino Wifi Rev2 and an LCD shield
from DFRobot. For our sensor, we are going to be using these low-cost
capacitive moisture sensors. This sample project uses only one sensor, but
you can connect up to five sensors to the LCD shield. Since this project is
going to be connected to the internet, it requires access to an
internet-connected WiFi network.

Additionally, you will also need a free flespi account. Go to the flespi page
and create an account before you continue with the project. You should select
the MQTT option when creating your account since the project uses the MQTT
protocol for transmission. After logging into your account, copy the token
shown on the “Tokens” page, as you will need it to set up the code.
